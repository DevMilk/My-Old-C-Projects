# C-Neural-Network-Project-2019-
Neural Network project in C


-Training is not fully optimized but it works very fast compared to high-level languages like Python and uses threads to speed up backpropogation and feed-forward functions


-I wrote library using only C standart libraries

-Users can create topology of their Neural Network with Layer Count, hyperparameters, Neurons Per Layer, Activation Functions per layer as they wish quickly with functions at MyNNLib.h library.

-Users can initialize sample set using training set structures and functions in MyNNLib.h library

-Users can train Neural Network they created with training sample set also they created, using train function in MyNNLib.h library

-Users can save or load Neural Network as binary file

-Example Neural Network program can be viewed in repository
